This package contains the data files of the game Zelda: Mystery of Solarus DX.
This quest is a free, open-source game that works with Solarus,
an open-source Zelda-like 2D game engine.
To play this game, you need Solarus.
We assume in this readme that Solarus is already installed.

See our development blog (http://www.solarus-games.org) to get more
information and documentation about Solarus and our games.

1  Play directly
----------------

You need to specify to the solarus binary the path of the quest data files to
use.
solarus accepts two forms of quest paths:
- a directory having a subdirectory named "data" with all data inside,
- a directory having a zip archive "data.solarus" with all data inside.

Thus, to run zsdx, if the current directory is the one that
contains the "data" subdirectory (and this readme), you can type

$ solarus .

or without arguments:

$ solarus

if solarus was compiled with the default quest set to ".".

2  Install the quest
--------------------


2.1  Default settings
----------------------

If you want to install zsdx, cmake and zip are recommended.
Just type

$ cmake .
$ make

This generates the "data.solarus" archive that contains all data files
of the quest. You can then install it with

# make install

This installs the following files (assuming that the install directory
is /usr/local):
- the quest data archive ("data.solarus") in /usr/local/share/solarus/zsdx/
- a script called "zsdx" in /usr/local/bin/

The zsdx script launches solarus with the appropriate command-line argument
to specify the quest path.
This means that you can launch the zsdx quest with the command:

$ zsdx

which is equivalent to:

$ solarus /usr/local/share/solarus/zsdx


3.2  Change the install directory
---------------------------------

You may want to install zsdx in another directory
(e.g. so that no root access is necessary). You can specify this directory
as a parameter of cmake:

$ cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/your_directory .
$ make
$ make install

This installs the files described above, with the
/usr/local prefix replaced by the one you specified.
The script generated runs solarus with the appropriate quest path.
